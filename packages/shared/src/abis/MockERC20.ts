/**
 * Hand-written minimal ERC-20 fragment, standard ERC-20 plus `mint` — used for Sepolia's MockUSDC,
 * confirmed permissionless-mint (see `contracts/src/interfaces/IMintableERC20.sol`'s NatSpec).
 * The onboarding wizard's "get test USDC" button calls `mint` directly from the visitor's own
 * wallet; it is a frontend affordance only, never something a factory contract calls.
